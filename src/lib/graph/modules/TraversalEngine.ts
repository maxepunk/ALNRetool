 * 
 * // Investigate character relationships
 * const engine = new TraversalEngine();
 * const characterEdges = await fetchCharacterRelationships(caseId);
 * 
 * // Find all characters within 2 degrees of primary suspect
 * const suspectNetwork = engine.traverse(characterEdges, primarySuspectId, {
 *   algorithm: 'bfs',
 *   maxDepth: 2,
 *   includeReverse: true
 * });
