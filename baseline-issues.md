=== Known Issues Before Fix ===
1. Dual cache updates cause entity sync issues
2. N+1 queries cause 8-10 second load times
3. Sequential data fetching causes blank screen
4. 12 test failures (edge label issues)

=== Fix Applied ===
Phase 1: Remove Dual Cache Update Pattern
- Removed lines 113-143 from entityMutations.ts
- Parent relation updates now handled server-side only
- Added performance monitoring to track cache updates

=== Expected Behavior After Fix ===
- Single cache update per entity creation (not 2)
- No entity duplication or disappearing issues
- Parent relations still work correctly
- Server handles atomic updates
