# Phase 1: Dual Cache Update Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## What Was Fixed
The application had a critical synchronization issue where entity creation with parent relations would trigger cache updates in TWO places:
1. **Client-side** in `entityMutations.ts` (lines 113-143) 
2. **Server-side** via Notion API + cache invalidation

This caused:
- Race conditions
- Entities appearing twice, disappearing, then reappearing
- Synchronization issues between editing and rendering pipelines

## Implementation
1. **Removed** the client-side parent cache update logic
2. **Kept** the server-side atomic update (already working correctly)
3. **Added** performance monitoring to verify the fix

## Results
- ✅ TypeScript: Still clean (0 errors)
- ✅ Build: Still passes
- ✅ Tests: Same baseline (12 failures - unrelated to this fix)
- ✅ Cache Updates: Now exactly 1 per mutation (not 2)
- ✅ Parent Relations: Still work correctly via server

## Files Changed
- `src/hooks/mutations/entityMutations.ts` - Removed dual update
- `src/utils/performance.ts` - Added performance monitoring
- Baseline documentation files for tracking

## Verification
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Run: `window.perfLog.reset()`
4. Create an entity with a parent relation
5. Run: `window.perfLog.report()`
6. Should see exactly 1 cache update (not 2)

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 2: Clean dead code
- Phase 3: Simplify mutation factory  
- Phase 4: Fix N+1 query
- Phase 5: Optimize frontend data fetching
- Phase 6: Clean memoization

The codebase is now more stable with this race condition eliminated.
