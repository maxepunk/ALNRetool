- [x] Implement 113 unit tests with 90.17% code coverage
- [x] Fix all TypeScript errors and test failures
- [ ] Create React Flow component integration
- [ ] Add basic interactivity and custom node types

**Days 8-9: First View (Puzzle Focus)**
- [ ] Build Puzzle Focus View component
- [ ] Connect to React Query hooks
- [ ] Implement filtering system
- [ ] Add details panel
- [ ] Style with CSS modules

**Day 10: Sprint 1 Integration**
- [ ] End-to-end testing of full stack
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Sprint 1 demo preparation

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **3-file type system** instead of 8+ files
  - `raw.ts`: Notion API types
  - `app.ts`: Clean UI types  
  - `transforms.ts`: Conversion functions
- **Express proxy pattern** for API security
- **Bottleneck rate limiting** to respect Notion limits
- **TanStack Query data layer** with 5-minute stale time
- **Query key factories** for centralized cache management
- **Three-layer error boundaries** with QueryErrorResetBoundary
- **No index.ts re-exports** (simpler imports)
- **No express-validator** (custom validation works fine)

### Testing Strategy
- **Triple test suites**: Smoke tests (mock data) + Integration tests (real Notion) + React Query tests (Vitest)
- **Vitest for frontend testing** with Mock Service Worker (MSW)
- **Native Node.js test runner** for backend tests
- **Manual + automated testing** hybrid approach
- **212 frontend tests** covering all hooks, API client, and error boundaries
- **Integration tests validate**: Data structure, SF_ patterns, rate limiting

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive from Day 1** for team continuity
- **API-first documentation** (contract before code)
- **Onboarding focus** (new devs every sprint)

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues
- None - all integration tests passing (23/23 = 100%)
- All critical functionality working: authentication, CORS, rate limiting, transforms, caching, validation

### Technical Debt  
- No frontend component tests

### Recent Improvements
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline Added**: GitHub Actions workflow with 4 job stages
- âœ… **Automated Quality Checks**: ESLint, TypeScript, tests run on every push
- âœ… **Bundle Size Monitoring**: 2MB limit enforced automatically

### Future Considerations
- Add component library documentation
- Setup automated deployments (CD portion)
- Add performance monitoring
- Add E2E testing with Playwright

## Team Notes

### Wins This Week
- Clean architecture established
- All Notion endpoints working
- React Query data layer complete with 212/212 tests passing
- Comprehensive documentation completed
- Rate limiting prevents 429 errors
- Type safety throughout codebase
- Three-layer error boundary system implemented
- MSW testing infrastructure established

### Challenges Overcome
- Environment variable loading timing (lazy init)
- Notion pagination handling (fetch all)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- CORS configuration for dev

### Lessons Learned
- Start with documentation saves time
- Smoke tests catch integration issues
- Type transformers simplify frontend
- Rate limiting needs two layers

## Sprint Velocity

### Week 1 Metrics
- **Planned**: 5 days of tasks
- **Completed**: Days 1-5 + Most of Days 6-7
- **Velocity**: 140% 
- **Quality**: High (325/325 total tests passing)
  - 212 React Query tests
  - 113 Graph transformation tests (90.17% coverage)
  - 23 Notion integration tests

### Predictions
- **Sprint 1 Completion**: On track for Day 10
- **MVP Delivery**: On track for Week 8
- **Risk Level**: Low

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Begin Day 6: React Flow integration
2. Continue testing with real Notion data
3. Update this dashboard daily

### Next Week
1. Complete first view (Puzzle Focus)
2. Demo to stakeholders
3. Plan Sprint 2 in detail

### Before Sprint 2
1. Create component style guide
2. Document React Flow patterns
3. Setup CI/CD pipeline
