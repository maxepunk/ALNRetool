## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **3-file type system** instead of 8+ files
  - `raw.ts`: Notion API types
  - `app.ts`: Clean UI types  
  - `transforms.ts`: Conversion functions
- **Express proxy pattern** for API security
- **Bottleneck rate limiting** to respect Notion limits
- **TanStack Query data layer** with 5-minute stale time
- **Query key factories** for centralized cache management
- **Three-layer error boundaries** with QueryErrorResetBoundary
- **No index.ts re-exports** (simpler imports)
- **No express-validator** (custom validation works fine)
- **Early-binding parent-child resolver** for compound graphs
  - Parent relationships established during transformation phase
  - Parent-aware orphan filtering preserves hierarchies
  - Compound layout focuses on positioning only

### Testing Strategy
- **Triple test suites**: Integration tests (real Notion) + React Query tests (Vitest) + Component tests
- **Test Coverage**: 504/509 tests passing (99.0% success rate)
  - Integration tests: 23/23 (100%) - Backend validation
  - React Query tests: All passing - Data layer coverage
  - Graph transformation: 123/123 (100%) - Algorithm coverage
  - Component tests: All passing (CSS module issues fixed)
- **Vitest for frontend testing** with Mock Service Worker (MSW)
- **Integration tests validate**: Authentication, CORS, rate limiting, caching, SF_ patterns
- **Missing**: E2E tests, mutation tests, optimistic update tests

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive from Day 1** for team continuity
- **API-first documentation** (contract before code)
- **Onboarding focus** (new devs every sprint)

## Known Issues & Blockers

### ‚úÖ Production Deployment Fixed (Jan 16, 2025)
- **Root Cause**: dotenv was loading .env files in production, overriding Render's environment variables
- **Solution**: Modified server/index.ts to prevent dotenv loading when NODE_ENV=production
- **Status**: All API endpoints now working in production on Render.com

### Current Test Suite Status: 504/509 passing (99.0%) ‚úÖ
- **Unit tests**: 504 passing, 5 skipped (Sprint 2 features)
- **Integration tests**: 23/23 passing (100%)
- **Graph transformation**: 123/123 passing (100%)
- **Component tests**: All passing
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliant
- **ESLint**: Clean build

### Sprint 2 Requirements - Mutation Infrastructure Needed
- [ ] Express PUT/PATCH endpoints for all 4 entities
- [ ] useMutation hooks with optimistic updates
- [ ] MSW handlers for mutation testing
- [ ] Toast notification system (react-hot-toast)
- [ ] Error recovery and rollback patterns
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
