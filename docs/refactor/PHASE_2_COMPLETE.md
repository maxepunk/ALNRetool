# Phase 2: Clean Dead Code - COMPLETE âœ…

## Summary
Phase 2 focused on removing dead code and unused imports. While the plan called for extensive cleanup, most of the dead code (useCacheInvalidation.ts, useSynthesizedData.ts) had already been removed in previous work on this branch.

## What Was Done
1. **ESLint Auto-fix** - Ran `npx eslint . --fix` to:
   - Remove unused imports automatically
   - Clean up formatting issues
   - Remove outdated comments

2. **Verified Zombie Files** - Confirmed already deleted:
   - `src/hooks/useCacheInvalidation.ts` - Already removed
   - `src/hooks/useSynthesizedData.ts` - Already removed
   - No old/deprecated directories found

3. **Testing** - Verified:
   - TypeScript still compiles cleanly (0 errors)
   - Build still passes
   - No new errors introduced

## Minimal Changes
Phase 2 had minimal impact because:
- Previous work on this branch had already removed most dead code
- The codebase was cleaner than expected
- ESLint only found minor comment cleanup needed

## Files Changed
- `server/config/index.ts` - Removed 3 lines of outdated comments

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with:
- Phase 3: Simplify mutation factory
- Phase 4: Fix N+1 query performance  
- Phase 5: Optimize frontend data fetching
- Phase 6: Clean memoization

The codebase is now cleaner with less dead code, making future phases easier to implement.
