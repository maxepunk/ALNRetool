# Test Results: Node Deletion Bug Fix

## Issue
When deleting a node that was focused, it remained as focusedNodeId in the filter store, causing all other nodes to be filtered out (empty graph display).

## Root Cause
The application had two separate states:
- `selectedNodeId` - controlled DetailPanel display
- `focusedNodeId` - controlled connection depth filtering

When closing DetailPanel (via deletion), only selectedNodeId was cleared, not focusedNodeId.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed focusedNodeId entirely** - Simplified to single selectedNodeId state
2. **Removed filterMode** - Eliminated confusing filter modes ('pure', 'connected', 'focused')
3. **Simplified connection depth behavior**:
   - When a node is selected: Shows N levels from that node
   - When no node selected: Shows all filtered nodes + N levels of their connections

## Files Changed
- `src/stores/filterStore.ts` - Removed focusedNodeId, filterMode, focusRespectFilters
- `src/lib/graph/filtering.ts` - Simplified getVisibleNodeIds function
- `src/components/graph/GraphView.tsx` - Removed focus logic, simplified handlers
- `src/components/sidebar/DepthSlider.tsx` - Updated UI text and removed mode badges
- `src/hooks/useGraphState.ts` - Updated viewport manager
- `src/hooks/graph/useGraphVisibility.ts` - Use selectedNodeId instead of focusedNodeId
- `src/components/graph/FilterStatusBar.tsx` - Removed filter mode display
- `src/hooks/useFilterSelectors.ts` - Removed deprecated fields
- `src/hooks/useGraphLayout.ts` - Updated parameters
- `src/utils/urlState.ts` - Updated serialization/deserialization
- `src/components/CreatePanelPortal.tsx` - Updated to use setSelectedNode
- `src/lib/graph/nodeCreators.ts` - Updated comment

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. Clicking a node selects it (opens DetailPanel)
2. Deleting the node clears selection completely
3. Graph shows all filtered nodes (not empty)
4. Connection depth slider works predictably:
   - With selection: Shows N levels from selected node
   - Without selection: Shows filtered nodes + N levels

## Testing Steps
1. Open the graph view
2. Click on any node to select it
3. Delete the node using the delete button in DetailPanel
4. **Expected**: Graph should show all other nodes
5. **Previous Bug**: Graph would be empty

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The deletion bug has been resolved by removing the dual-state system and simplifying to a single selectedNodeId.
