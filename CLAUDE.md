### Notion Database Schema

#### Characters Database (`18c2f33d-583f-8060-a6ab-de32ff06bca2`)

| Field | Type | Purpose | Design Implications |
|-------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Name** | Title | Character identifier | Display name in graphs |
| **Type** | Select (NPC/Player) | Playable vs non-playable | Filter option, visual distinction |
| **Tier** | Select (Core/Secondary/Tertiary) | Narrative importance; Core=5 minimum players | Node importance/size, filter priority |
| **Owned Elements** | Relation (synced with Elements.Owner) | Items character starts with or POV memories | Primary puzzle access paths |
| **Associated Elements** | Relation | Narratively connected items | Secondary connections |

| **Puzzle** | Title | Puzzle identifier | Node labels |
| **Description/Solution** | Rich Text | How to solve | Mechanic documentation |
| **Puzzle Elements** | Relation (synced with Elements.Required For) | Required elements | Dependency visualization |
| **Locked Item** | Relation (synced with Elements.Container Puzzle) | Container this opens | Ownership derivation |
| **Owner** | Rollup (Locked Item â†’ Owner, function: show_unique) | Character who "owns" puzzle | Access paths |
| **Rewards** | Relation (synced with Elements.Rewarded By) | Elements gained | Outcome flows |

| **Narrative Threads** | Rollup (Rewards â†’ Narrative Threads, function: show_unique) | Story categories touched | Thread connections |
| **Asset Link** | URL | External documentation | Design reference |

**Key Insight**: Puzzle "ownership" derives from who owns the locked container - creating natural starting points for puzzle chains. No difficulty field exists in the schema.

#### Timeline Database (`1b52f33d-583f-80de-ae5a-d20020c120dd`)

| Field | Type | Purpose | Design Implications |
|-------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Description** | Title | Event summary | Event labels |
| **Date** | Date | When it happened | Timeline ordering |
| **Characters Involved** | Relation (synced with Characters.Events) | Who was present | Connection building |
| **Memory/Evidence** | Relation (synced with Elements.Timeline Event) | How players learn this | Discovery paths |
| **mem type** | Rollup (Memory/Evidence â†’ Basic Type, function: show_unique) | Type of evidence | Discovery medium |
| **Notes** | Rich Text | Design notes | Context |
| **Last edited time** | Last Edited Time | Modification tracking | Version awareness |

**Design Intent**: Timeline events ARE the backstory. Players experience collective amnesia and rediscover these through elements. The murder is one thread among many mysteries.

## Key Development Principles

### React Flow Implementation
- Use controlled flow with `nodes` and `edges` state
- Implement custom node types for each entity (Character, Element, Puzzle)
- Handle node updates via `onNodesChange` callback
- Use `@xyflow/react` for the core React Flow components

### Notion API Integration
- All data mutations go through TanStack Query's `useMutation`
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Handle rate limits gracefully (3 requests/second)
- Cache data aggressively with 5-minute stale time
- Always validate Notion responses against expected schema

### 2-Way Sync Architecture
```typescript
// Example mutation pattern
const updatePuzzle = useMutation({
  mutationFn: async (data) => {
    // 1. Optimistic update
    // 2. Call Notion API
    // 3. Handle success/failure
    // 4. Update local cache
  },
  onError: () => {
    // Rollback optimistic update
    // Show error toast
  }
});
```

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Inline editing: Double-click to edit, click outside to save
- Visual feedback: Highlight nodes on hover, show loading states
- Fail gracefully: Never lose user edits, queue failed updates
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+S to save, Esc to cancel
- Responsive design: Support 1024px minimum width

### Performance Considerations
- Virtualize large graphs (100+ nodes) with React Flow's built-in support
- Debounce search/filter operations by 300ms
- Lazy load character artwork and full text content
- Use React.memo for node components
- Implement pagination for Notion queries (max 100 items)

### Security & Error Handling
- Never expose Notion API token in frontend code
- Route all Notion requests through Express backend
- Validate all user inputs before sending to Notion
- Implement retry logic for failed Notion requests
- Log errors with context for debugging

## Backend Development Patterns

### Caching Architecture

**Server-Side Caching**: Implemented with node-cache to reduce Notion API load
- **5-minute TTL**: Matches React Query frontend cache duration
- **Cache-first pattern**: Check cache â†’ Return if hit â†’ Fetch from Notion on miss
- **Cache key format**: `{endpoint}:{limit}:{cursor}` (e.g., `characters:20:null`)
- **Bypass mechanism**: `X-Cache-Bypass: true` header forces fresh data
- **Response headers**: `X-Cache-Hit: true/false` indicates cache status
- **Management endpoints**: `/api/cache/stats`, `/api/cache/clear`, `/api/cache/clear/:endpoint`

**Performance Impact**:
- Cached responses: <50ms (vs 200-3000ms for Notion API)
- Notion API calls reduced by 70-80% for repeated requests
- Rate limiting preserved for actual Notion calls only

### Input Validation

**Pagination Validation**: Applied to all Notion endpoints
- **Limit**: Must be between 1-100 (400 error if invalid)
- **Cursor**: Must be string type if provided
- **Applied via middleware**: Runs before authentication to fail fast
- **Error codes**: `INVALID_LIMIT`, `INVALID_CURSOR`

### Explicit Typing Pattern for API Endpoints

**CRITICAL**: All new Notion API endpoints must follow this exact pattern to prevent runtime errors and ensure type safety.

```typescript
// 1. AsyncHandler Pattern with Explicit Types
import { asyncHandler } from '../utils/asyncHandler.js';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

router.get('/endpoint', asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Explicit Request, Response types prevent TypeScript inference issues
  // asyncHandler prevents server crashes from unhandled promise rejections
}));

// 2. Generic API Response Typing
import type { APIResponse, EntityType } from '../../src/types/notion/app.js';

const response: APIResponse<EntityType> = {
  data: transformedEntities,
  nextCursor: null,
  hasMore: false
};
// Use explicit APIResponse<T> generic - never use typeof inference

// 3. Separation of Raw vs App Types
import type { NotionPage, NotionProperty } from '../../src/types/notion/raw.js';
import type { Character, Element } from '../../src/types/notion/app.js';
// Keep raw Notion types separate from clean app types
```

**Why This Pattern?**
- **Server Stability**: AsyncHandler catches unhandled promise rejections that crash Express servers
- **Type Safety**: Explicit typing prevents silent field loss during JSON serialization
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation between Notion's complex types and our domain models

**Lessons Learned - Server Stability:**
- Unhandled async errors in Express routes cause silent server crashes during integration tests
- TypeScript `typeof` inference can strip fields from API responses
- Process-level error handlers provide final safety net but should not be relied upon
- Always wrap async route handlers with `asyncHandler` utility

### Integration Testing Strategy

**Current Status**: Full integration test suite implemented (`scripts/integration-test.ts`)
- **100% test coverage** (23/23 tests passing) covering:
  - All 4 Notion API endpoints (characters, elements, puzzles, timeline)
  - Authentication (API key validation)
  - CORS configuration
  - Rate limiting (Bottleneck and Express)
  - **Cache behavior** (hit/miss, bypass, key generation)
  - **Input validation** (limit ranges, cursor format)
  - SF_ pattern parsing from real data
- **Permissive parsing** for unknown data schemas (future-proof)
- **Server stability testing** with rate limiting and CORS validation

Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`

## Testing Approach

### Current Test Infrastructure âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering all API endpoints
- **Location**: `scripts/integration-test.ts`
- **Coverage**: All 4 Notion API endpoints (characters, elements, puzzles, timeline)
- **Features**: Authentication testing, rate limiting validation, CORS verification, error handling
- **Run**: `npm run test:integration`

**Test Strategy**:
- Real Notion API integration (no mocks)
- Permissive parsing for unknown data schemas (future-proof)
- Server stability validation (prevents crashes during load)
- 100% pass rate required before any commits

### Future Test Implementation:
- Unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Component tests for React Flow custom nodes
- E2E tests for critical user flows (create, edit, delete)
- Mock Notion API responses for faster development testing

```

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Node Type
1. Create component in `src/components/nodes/`
2. Define TypeScript interface in `src/types/`
3. Register in React Flow's `nodeTypes`
4. Add styling in component's CSS module

### Implementing a Notion Mutation
1. Create mutation function in `src/services/notion.ts`
2. Define React Query mutation in relevant hook
3. Add optimistic update logic
4. Handle errors with toast notifications
5. Update TypeScript types if needed

### Debugging React Flow Issues
- Check `useNodesState` and `useEdgesState` hooks
- Verify node IDs are unique
- Ensure `nodeTypes` are registered before render
- Use React DevTools to inspect flow state
- Check browser console for React Flow warnings
